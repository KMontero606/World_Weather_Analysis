# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview:
  Beta testers are loving the new PlanMyTrip app and they have recommended a few changes to improve the app to be more interactive. Specifically, they recommend the following:

* Retrieve Additional Weather Data
* Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Results:

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Using OpenWeatherMap, an API call was performed to gather additional weather data from 2000 random-generated coordinates then tabulated into an excel csv file.
