# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview:
  Beta testers are loving the new PlanMyTrip app and they have recommended a few changes to improve the app to be more interactive. Specifically, they recommend the following:

* Retrieve Additional Weather Data
* Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Results:

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Using OpenWeatherMap, an API call was performed to gather additional weather data from 2000 random-generated coordinates then tabulated into an excel csv file.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Using Google Maps Platform, an API call was performed to gather possible travel destinations with corresponding hotels within a 5000 meter radius.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itenarary Map
Using Google Directions Platform, an API call was performed to create an itenarary map based on four chosen cities within the same country by the end user's weather preferences. The itenarary map also shows corresponding hotels for each destination chosen.

## Summary:
I find this module 6 challenging as it does require you to recall previous lessons and incorporate them into the code. I would be referring back to previous lessons to refresh my memory of how the script/syntax works. I also find this challenge quite enjoyable and informative as it pulls real-time data.
