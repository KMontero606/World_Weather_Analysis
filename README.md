## Project Overview:
  Beta testers are loving the new PlanMyTrip app and they have recommended a few changes to improve the app to be more interactive. Specifically, they recommend the following:

* Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
* Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Results:

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Using OpenWeatherMap, an API call was performed to gather weather data for random coordinates.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Using Google API, an API call was performed to gather possible travel destinations with corresponding hotels.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itenarary Map
Using Google Directions API, an API call was performed to create an itenarary map based on four chosen cities in the same country by the end user.
